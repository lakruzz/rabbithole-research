# Prompts

I'll show you two prompts I've used one for Chat GPT 3.5 and another for Bing chat. In both prompts I instruct the chat to give the output in MarkDown and I give further details to the format of the output. These prompts will generate short generic replies in a uniform way, nicely formatted in MarkDown so you can simply copy the reply and paste it into any MarkDown compliant media such as GitHub issues, GitHub discussions, `.md` files, Trello _cards_, JAM stack content, GitBook - etc.

## Chat GPT

Go to https://chat.openai.com, set up an account (the free version is quite sufficient for this exercise).

The following prompt asks for an excerpt, a 10 point list and a summary on a specific concept.

> Describe the concept **"Citizen Development"** in an excerpt of just a few sentences. Then list the 10 most important aspects that make up the concept and elaborate in a few sentences on each of the items in your list. Generate the output in MarkDown. Let the heading be the concept we're exploring.

[See this example live on openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/share/2c8f2396-078f-451a-99c7-ba8f062472e5) and continue the chat in the capacity of your own account.

## Bing chat

Go to https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx in an Edge browser. **Note:** this only works in Edge, so you must install Edge on your PC first. **Also note:** This will not work with a restricted account (e.g. your `kea.dk` account doesn't work) setup your own personal (free) account. **Tip:** If you give the email axssociated with you GitHub account, Bing will offer you to authenticate with GitHub - and you don't need to setup an account from scratch.

I altered the prompt for Bing, a bit - semantically though, they are exactly the same:

>Describe the concept "Citizen Development".
>
>Note on the output:
>- Generate the reply in MarkDown.
>- Let the heading be the concept we're exploring.
>- Start with an excerpt of just a few sentences.
>- Then give a list the 5 most important aspects that make up the concept and elaborate in a few sentences on each of the items in your list.
>- Finally throw in a short summary in the end.

## Chat GPT vs. Bing Chat

Chat GPT - even v3.5 - is really fast, and Bing chat is really slow.
Chat GPT does not have access to external websites whereas Bing Chat can utilize the entire internet.
Chat GPT does not give sources to it's claims whereas Bing Chat does.
Chat GPT works in any browser Bing Chat only works in Edge.
