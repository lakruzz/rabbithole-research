Go to https://chat.openai.com and start a new prompt (the free version is quite sufficient for this exercise)

The following prompt asks for an excerpt, a 10 point list and a summary on a specific concept.

> _Describe the concept **"Citizen Development"** in an excerpt of just a few sentences. Then list the 10 most important aspects that make up the concept and elaborate in a few sentences on each of the items in your list. Generate the output in MarkDown. Let the heading be the concept we're exploring._

[See it live](https://chat.openai.com/share/2c8f2396-078f-451a-99c7-ba8f062472e5) and continut the chat in the capacity of your own account.

Use this prompt simply by changing the quoted concept to whatever you want to research and let the rest of the prompt stay the same. This prompt chat will generate short generic replies in a uniform way, nicely formatted in MarkDown. You can simply copy the reply and paste it into any MarkDown compliant media such as GitHub issues, GitHub discussions, `.md` files, Trello _cards_, JAM stack content, GitBook - etc.
