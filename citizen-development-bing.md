Citizen Development
---
Citizen development is a business practice where non-IT employees create applications for their own or others' use, using tools that are approved by IT. Citizen development enables faster and more customized solutions for business problems, without requiring coding skills or IT resources¹²³. Some of the aspects that make up the concept of citizen development are:

- **Low-code/no-code platforms**: These are tools that allow users to create applications by using graphical interfaces, drag-and-drop features, pre-built templates, and workflows. Low-code/no-code platforms simplify and automate the development process, making it accessible to non-IT users¹²³.
- **Business technologists**: These are employees who have both business and technical skills, and can leverage technology to solve business problems. Business technologists are not necessarily citizen developers, but they can use low-code/no-code platforms to create applications that support their business goals¹.
- **IT governance**: This is the process of ensuring that IT resources are aligned with business objectives, and that IT risks are managed effectively. IT governance involves setting policies, standards, and guidelines for IT activities, as well as monitoring and controlling IT performance and compliance. IT governance is essential for citizen development, as it ensures that the applications created by non-IT users are secure, reliable, and consistent with IT best practices¹².
- **Business agility**: This is the ability of an organization to adapt quickly and effectively to changing customer needs, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Business agility requires a culture of innovation, collaboration, and experimentation, as well as flexible and scalable processes and systems. Citizen development supports business agility by enabling faster and more responsive application delivery, as well as empowering users to create solutions that meet their specific needs²³.
- **Value creation**: This is the act of adding value to an organization or its customers. Value creation involves increasing revenue, reducing costs, improving quality etc. Value creation is the ultimate goal of citizen development as it demonstrates how the applications created by non-IT users contribute to the organization's success[^2 ^][ ^3 ^].

In summary: Citizen development is a way of empowering non-IT employees to create applications using low-code/no-code platforms that are approved by IT. Citizen development can help organizations achieve better governance, agility etc.
